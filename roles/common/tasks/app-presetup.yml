- name: adding Roboshop application User
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: roboshop
  register: appuser


##tthe below code is commented because to follow the standard process of downloading the content from artifact manager rather than downloading git hub repo.
#- name: removing old content
#  ansible.builtin.file:
#    path: /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}
#    state: absent

#- name: downloading app web content and Extract it
#  ansible.builtin.unarchive:
#    src: https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/{{COMPONENT}}/archive/main.zip
#    dest: /tmp
#    remote_src: yes

#- name: Copy Extracted Content
#  ansible.builtin.copy:
#    src: /tmp/{{COMPONENT}}-main/
#    dest: /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}
#    remote_src: yes
#    ## Set to true to indicate the archived file is already on the remote system and not local to the Ansible controller.
#  become_user: roboshop



## here we are downloading artifacts from nexus rather than downloading from git
- name: Create Application Directory
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}-tmp
    state: directory
    owner: roboshop
    group: roboshop


- name: downloading app web content and Extract it
  ansible.builtin.unarchive:
    src: http://{{NEXUS_USER}}:{{NEXUS_PASS}}@nexus.roboshop.internal:8081/repository/{{COMPONENT}}/{{COMPONENT}}-{{APP_VERSION}}.zip
    dest: /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}-tmp
    remote_src: yes
  become_user: roboshop

- name: Clean UP old App Content
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}
    state: absent

## this approach has been taken to avoid application downtime if the download file is high and also download speed is low.
- name: Rename Dir
  ansible.builtin.shell: mv /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}-tmp /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}
