##tthe below code is commented because to follow the standard process of downloading the content from artifact manager rather than downloading git hub repo.

#    dest: /home/roboshop/{{COMPONENT}}
#    remote_src: yes
#    ## Set to true to indicate the archived file is already on the remote system and not local to the Ansible controller.
